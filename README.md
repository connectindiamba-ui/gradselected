This structure reflects the current repository, which contains the `app`, `components`, `data`, `lib`, `public`, and `scripts` directories.

# Data Architecture

MBAConnectIndia currently uses structured JSON datasets for education-related information.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    DATA[Education Data]

    DATA --> COLLEGES[colleges.json]
    DATA --> ENGINEERING[engineering.json]
    DATA --> FOREIGN[foreign.json]

    COLLEGES --> APP[Next.js Application]
    ENGINEERING --> APP
    FOREIGN --> APP

    APP --> USER[Website Visitor]
```

The data layer is intentionally separated from the UI so that educational information can be updated without redesigning the application.

---

# Data Synchronization

The repository also contains:

```text
scripts/sync-sheets.mjs
```

This script is responsible for synchronizing configured Google Sheets data into local JSON datasets.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant SHEET as Google Sheets
    participant SCRIPT as sync-sheets.mjs
    participant JSON as JSON Files
    participant NEXT as Next.js
    participant USER as Student

    SHEET->>SCRIPT: Export worksheet data
    SCRIPT->>SCRIPT: Parse CSV
    SCRIPT->>JSON: Generate JSON
    JSON->>NEXT: Load data
    NEXT->>USER: Display information
```

> **Production recommendation:** If MBAConnectIndia is intended to operate as a fully static website, the JSON files can become the primary source of truth and the Google Sheets synchronization dependency can be removed.

---

# Recommended Static Architecture

For a production-oriented deployment, the preferred architecture is:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    ADMIN[Business / Content Administrator]

    ADMIN --> JSON[JSON Data]

    JSON --> GIT[Git Repository]

    GIT --> BUILD[Next.js Production Build]

    BUILD --> VERCEL[Vercel]

    VERCEL --> WEBSITE[MBAConnectIndia]

    WEBSITE --> STUDENTS[Students]
```

### Benefits

- No runtime dependency on Google Sheets
- Faster page delivery
- Predictable builds
- Easier backups
- Version-controlled data
- Easier migration between hosting providers
- Suitable for a primarily static website

```

Avoid unnecessarily duplicating UI code across pages.

---

Maintain consistent JSON structures.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Example College",

    "category": "Engineering"
  }
]
```

When updating data:

1. Preserve existing fields.

3. Avoid accidental field renaming.
4. Validate JSON.
5. Test affected pages.
6. Verify production build.

---

# Git Workflow
